# FlyTransferCups_v10
FlyCup for transfering fruit flies in standard 48 well trays.
A fruit fly transfer lid is constructed from a layer of nylon mesh bonded between an array of cups (FlyCup48_cup_v10.stl) and holes (FlyCup48_stud_v10.stl). Studs in the hole layer pass through corresponding holes in the cup and nylon layers, creating individual gas exchange tops for each well. A hot soldering iron, guided by holes in a metal template, creates holes in the nylon mesh. The final assembly studs are bonded with cyanoacrylate glue.  When placed on a CO2 plate, anesthetized flies fall into their corresponding cup, enabling the plate to be replaced and flipped, simultaneously transferring all flies into new wells. The cup and holes are fabricated by SLA 3D printing in LEDO 6060 Resin which provides high dimensional stability and good temperature resistance. Natural white is used to provide good contrast against the dark fruit flies.
